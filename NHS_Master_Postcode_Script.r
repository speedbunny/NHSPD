# Extract Postcode Information from NHSPD dataset (on GOV UK)
# Download location Office for National Statistics data - NHS Digital
# https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/data-downloads/office-for-national-statistics-data
# V1.0 - 140521 - Sarah Eaglesfield


#   ****     INSTRUCTIONS  ****
#There are 41 columns of data in the dataset. These are detailed on P27-P40 the User Guide PDF. 
#To Add An Additional Column 
#1. Download the corresponding lookup table from the above URL
#2. Change the col_type from col_skip to its actual type given in comments on the sam line
#3. Add the file location to the fnames list

#   ****     TROUBLESHOOTING  ****
#1. Make Sure The Path of the Filename is Set Correctly Relative to the Base Directory for R
#2. Some NHS Lookup Tables have 3 columns - drop the unneeded column on an adhoc basis


#   ****     MASTER COLUMN LIST - LOAD COLUMS THAT WILL BE EXPORTED AND SKIP OTHERS ****
